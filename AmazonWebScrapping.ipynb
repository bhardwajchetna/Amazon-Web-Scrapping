      "Feature List: ALLICIN: Garlic is one of nature’s best super foods due to its high antioxidant content. Allicin, believed to be the most beneficial property of garlic, is formed when garlic is crushed and lasts only about an hour after it has been formed. Recent studies have shown that allicin may not be responsible for garlic’s health benefits since it is not easily absorbed in the body. After ingestion, little to no traces of allicin is found in the body. || S-ALLYL-CYSTEINE: Fermenting garlic converts allicin into a stable and potent antioxidant, S-Allyl-Cysteine (SAC). SAC has twice the antioxidant capacity and is proven to be absorbed better than allicin. The benefits of SAC are as follows: Strengthens the immune system, improves cardiovascular health, helps in regulating blood pressure, natural antioxidant, decreases oxidative stress related to aging, 30 times less toxic than allicin, and twice the amount of antioxidant capacity than allicin. || WHY US: Our revolutionary fermentation process enhances the health benefits of garlic. We choose the most wholesome garlic bulbs which then undergoes our 2-step fermentation process, transforming the sulfur compound allicin into SAC. The black garlic is then left out to oxidize, crushed into powder form and encapsulated. Safety measures are applied to fully comply with GMP regulations. With our product, you are guaranteed to have the recommended dosage of at least 1.2mg of SAC per serving. || PURITY: Our product is manufactured in a GMP certified facility, as well as FDA registered facility. It is gluten-free, non GMO and vegan. We use all natural ingredients with minimal processing. Other brands of garlic supplements use extracts or concentrates so not all of the nutrients are retained in the product. Obtaining the most natural sources of superfoods with minimal amount of processing is our top priority. The proof is in our product. || OUR PROMISE: To prove how confident we are in our product, we will gladly refund your money within 30 days, if you are not completely satisfied with our product.\n",

      "Feature List: ✔ ESSENTIAL FOR ENZYME SUPPORT & BIOCHEMICAL REACTIONS - Over 200 of your body’s key enzymatic reactions depend on a healthy level of Zinc, and it's one of the few minerals that your body doesn't produce on its own. Not only is Zinc necessary for your body to function in a healthy manner, it must be consumed. Zinc is required for your body to maintain healthy cells || ✔ KEY TO IMMUNE DEFENSE AND WELLNESS - Maintaining a healthy level of zinc in your diet is required for your immune system to adapt to impurities that can cause illness. Keeping your immune system healthy is the first line of defense, and zinc is crucial to sustaining daily health. || ✔ VITAL TO HEALTHY AND ACCURATE CELL REPLICATION - Your body replaces all of its cells on a routine basis, some every few days, others every few years. Without zinc, your body cannot replicate cells as efficiently and as often as needed. A healthy intake of zinc allows your body to sufficiently build and store memories, maintain vision, and grow healthy hair and nails. It is also essential to maintain reproductive, respiratory and thryroid health. || ✔ ZINC GLUCONATE IS THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF ZINC - Because of the vast health benefits balanced with affordability, Zinc Gluconate is the most frequently used zinc in supplements and daily vitamins. Taking a specific Zinc-only supplement ensures that your body maintains and absorbs enough zinc (bioavailability) to maintain a healthy immune system. || ✔ ALLERGEN FREE & GUARANTEED SATISFACTION.

If We Could Make This Coffee Any Healthier We Would! Medium Roast. Also Comes With Free Special Report Called \"How To Make The Healthiest Cup Of Coffee\" || Healthy Coffee Rule #1) Always Go Organic. Why? Because conventional coffee is one of the most heavily treated crops. One of the many health risks with these chemicals is that they can act as \"xenoestrogens\" in your body disrupting hormone balance for both men and women. || Healthy Coffee Rule #2) Coffee Grown At High Altitude Is Better. Why? Because the higher the altitude the coffee is grown at, the denser the bean. You may have heard the term \"Strictly Hard Bean\" (SHB) which denotes an especially dense, high-altitude coffee. This Peak Performance Organic Coffee grown in the Guatemalan Highlands is a perfect example of this. This higher elevation bean is more dense and thus of a higher quality grade. High Altitude Coffee also tends to have more antioxidants! || Healthy Coffee Rule #3) Single Origin Coffee Is Better. Why? Because while \"Blended\" Coffee like a \"Breakfast Blend\" might sound cool... there's a much higher likelihood that at least one of the bean varieties that went into that blend was contaminated. || Over 300,000 Happy Customers + 1-for-1 Donation To Vitamins Angels - Peak Performance is celebrating over 300,000 happy customers and we are also very proud of our 1-for-1 donation match program.

      "Feature List: B12 Your Body Can Actually Absorb, And Quickly: Unlike pills, where the active ingredients must pass through the intestinal tract, Frunutta Vitamin B12 Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg Micro Quick Absorb tablets dissolve under the tongue to directly diffuse into the bloodstream providing faster, more complete absorption. B12 Cyanocobalamin is known to provide energy and support metabolic health, blood cells, and nerves. Each bottle contains 100 tablets. || No More Swallowing Pills: Frunutta produces small, pure tablets that dissolve under the tongue in seconds so you can safely get the crucial vitamins and minerals your body needs every day without having to swallow a pill. No swallowing. No shots. No water. No complaints! || Pure Vitamin … And None Of The \"Other” Stuff: Have you ever read the \"other ingredients\" in vitamin pills? They can include PCBs, magnesium stearate or silicate, and titanium dioxide! Pills are designed with a coating, made of ingredients your body doesn't need, to protect the vitamin from the harsh environment of the digestive tract. Our tablets get dissolved under the tongue and have no coating, so you won’t find chemicals or fillers here. Pure is better! || Full Transparency: Frunutta products are manufactured in our FDA-registered, NSF certified facility under strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) guidelines in California. The raw materials and finished products of every batch are tested for purity and potency by independent ISO 17025 accredited labs that comply with the most rigid industry standards. Frunutta products contain ingredients from the purest sources worldwide free of preservatives, GMOs, gluten, sugars, dyes, and excipients. || A Doctor’s Quest To Help His Child: It all began when a physician faced a problem shared by millions - his son was unable to swallow pills or absorb vitamins and nutrients due to a medical condition. He partnered with doctors & scientists to develop something genuinely new, a vitamin you don’t have to swallow that quickly dissolves under the tongue and delivers pure vitamins and minerals directly into the bloodstream.

Non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan, Kosher, suitable for a Halal diet; harvested and bottled in a cGMP compliant facility with multiple quality checks and inspections. || ESSENTIAL SELENIUM FOR A HEALTHY THYROID - Our thyroid glands need selenium to sufficiently produce all the necessary hormones for our bodies.

      "Feature List: More Potent Source Of B-Complex Vitamins - Our extra strength formula contains all the essential B Vitamins in just one capsule. If you'd rather take your B Vitamins (like B 12 & 6) together in one convenient capsule, look no further! Divine Bounty offers one of the most potent Vitamin B-Complex formulas available. || Best Value For Money - Not only do we offer a high potency formula, each bottle contains 90 B Complex capsules, making it one of the best value vitamin B supplements available. The B-complex group are water-soluble vitamins, not easily stored in the body and thus need to be replenished frequently. Most comparable brands offer less capsules or a lower potency formula. With more capsules per bottle and superior potency per capsule, Divine Bounty is great value for money. || Highest Quality Ingredients - Our formula is made up of only pure ingredients with no harmful additives. Simply the full B-Complex plus the combo of Inositol and Choline, two naturally occurring close cousins to the B Vitamin family. Our capsules are non GMO, soy free, gluten free and have no preservatives, stearates, silicone dioxide or artificial ingredients. A pure, clean formula. || Daily B Complex Vitamins - Our bodies use B vitamins every day, and while diet is always the best way to get these essential vitamins, it’s not always possible to get enough of all 8 b vitamins from food alone. Use the Divine Bounty B Complex formula to supplement any deficiencies. Also sometimes called Super B, Stress B Complex, or B-100, it can also be taken as powder, tablets, pills, or soft gel caps. || A Supplement You Can Take With Confidence - Divine Bounty is proudly made in the USA in an inspected facility. We stand behind our Vitamin B complex supplements and are proud to have the best formula on the market. If it doesn't work for you, let us know. We care about your results.

      "Feature List: THE PERFECT PARTNERSHIP - Protect your heart while supporting your bones and brain. Vitamin K2 & D3 were meant to go together. Our patented K2VITAL helps direct calcium to your bones and away from your arteries, reducing the risk of arterial calcification. Enjoy the maximum benefits of D3 for strong bones, healthy brain function, and immune system support with just the right amount of K2 for optimal heart health as nature intended. BioFlourish K2+D3 has you covered. || STRONG BONES, SUPPLE HEART - You want your bones to be strong but you want the rest of your body to be supple. Vitamin D3 enhances calcium absorption for solid bones. But excessive calcium absorption can be harmful as it settles into your joints, soft tissues, and arteries (hardening of the arteries). Research shows that Vitamin K2, in its most bioavailable form as MK-7, helps direct calcium into your bones and away from your soft-tissues--so they stay soft! || HEALTHY BRAIN - It's true. Body care is brain care. And exciting new research suggests that Vitamin D3 may help the brain maintain normal function by supporting new connections between neurons (a process called synaptogenesis) which is vital to normal brain growth and repair throughout life and especially as we age. This fact, combined with a greater concern for heart health as we age, makes the combination of K2 with D3 an essential part of your longevity tool kit. || PURE BY DESIGN - At BioFlourish, we make products for ourselves and our families so we select only the best - premium quality, all-natural, science-based ingredients, suitable for vegetarians. Our K2VITAL Reference Standard is the only standard specifically available for the analysis of Vitamin K2 MK‑7 in dietary supplements, nutraceutical raw materials, and finished goods. We set the bar that high, so you can reap the benefits of bone, brain, and heart health with peace of mind.\n",

Further studies have shown that a high Vitamin K intake is associated with improved cardiovascular health.

      "Feature List: Immune System Support: Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that our body cannot produce on its own. It is known for limiting the damage done by free radicals while supporting immune function and overall well-being. As a vitamin that supports immune function, as well as an essential cofactor in the synthesis of collagen, Vitamin C is a must to maintain health. || Vitamin C: Beneficial in the maintenance of heart health and aiding in the synthesis of collagen, a protein vital to the health of multiple parts of the body including blood vessels, bones, and skin. Vitamin C also helps with the absorption of iron. Because iron found in plant sources is not as easily absorbed as that from animals, if you live a meatless lifestyle, this vitamin may support your other nutrient needs! || Enhanced Absorption: All the benefits of this essential vitamin in liposomal form for enhanced absorption. Compared to a less bioavailable, unencapsulated Vitamin C, this Megadose Liposomal Vitamin C, with greater bioavailability, is delivered to your body via liposomal technology. || Easy-to-Take Liquid: With Megadose Vitamin C in easy-to-take liquid form, you can simply take it by mouth, add to a glass of water or your favorite morning juice, or add it into your favorite blended beverage! Shake gently before using. Take 7.5 mL (½ Tablespoon) daily. Each bottle comes with 30 servings. || Free of Common Allergens: Our Vitamin C Liquid Liposomal is Non-GMO, Vegan, and made in a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) Facility. Contains no Gluten, Wheat, Corn, Soy, Nuts, Dairy, Sugar, or Nightshades. 4000 mg Vitamin C Liposomal Proprietary Blend*, 500 mg Vitamin C, 3.4 mg Vitamin E. Free of all common allergens.\n",
